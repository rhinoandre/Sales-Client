It was another way to develop the exemple of the book: https://leanpub.com/livro-angularJS
I have used the book to learn a little more about AngularJS and since then I got more information about this amazing framework, then now I fill confortable to develop the same application but using more than the basics concepts

## Development

### Some libraries:
* `ui-router`: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
* `$resource`: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource
* `angular-toastr`: https://github.com/Foxandxss/angular-toastr
* `ngDialog`: https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog

##Build
To run this you'll need the backend provided by the book
npm install
bower install
Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.


## Testing
The tests aren't running yet, but I'll fix it
Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
